                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p class="collapse-text">Endear is a free matchmaking platform for finding your secret crush at Minerva. The platform is made to increase interactions among Minervans and is founded on the principles of <i>privacy, safety and mindful social connection</i>. To use the website, simply log in using your Minerva email and add your crush to see whether he/she/they like you back.</p>
                </div>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">How do you ensure security of the platform?</button>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p class="collapse-text">We believe that strong security is in solid engineering. Therefore, we have reduced the number of moving parts that can go wrong by using the Google OAuth for authentication, secure form submission and added security checks during deployment. All activity on the website such as the requests received by the server are logged and monitored to detect malicious entry when it happens.</p>
                </div>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">What data do you collect?</button>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p class="collapse-text">We only collect your email when authenticating as well as your first and last name for displaying to you and other users. All this information comes straight from your Gmail account and you do not need to fill in annoying forms. The information about your matches are stored as hashes and cross-referenced to our database of emails for verification. So only you and your crush know that you've matched.</p>
                </div>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">What if I do not get any matches?</button>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p class="collapse-text">Do not fret! Since the website is in its early stages, as more users join the site, the more your search space and potential crushes will increase. Alternatively, there is an option of forming new friendly connections with Minerva students who are not in your friend group. You never know, it could be a match made in heaven!</p>
                </div>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">What do I do after I have matched with my crush?</button>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p class="collapse-text">The website provides an option to create an event through Google Calendar (automatic calendar invites coming soon) after matching so that both of you can set up a date.</p>
                </div>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">What should I know before I sign up to the website?</button>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p class="collapse-text">There are certain constraints set in place to minimize spam as much as possible. <br/><br/>Firstly, only Minerva based emails are allowed for authentication i.e. <span style="font-family: Courier New; color: #000;">@uni.minerva.edu</span>. <br/><br/>Secondly, each user can match upto a maximum of 3 other students and can make upto 3 changes in a 24 hour period. This is to ensure that a user cannot bruteforce their hidden matches. <br/><br/>Lastly, you can't see your if a user has added you as a crush until you have added them as your crush too.</p>
