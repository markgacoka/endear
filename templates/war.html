        <p style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: 600;">My thoughts on Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the Morality of War</p>
        <p>I do not support war, but I support Ukraine's necessity of defending its home country against Putin's actions. The sad truth of life is that the defense against an aggressive oppressor is sufficient for war but necessary for the individual's preservation of life. I do not claim to understand what's going on in Ukraine. Even if I had been in a previous conflict, compassion does not grant me ownership of the situation. All suffering is different in its own way. Additionally, I understand that the conflict is Putin's choice, not Russia as a country. That is why I did not title this "Russia's invasion of Ukraine."

            <p style="font-weight: 600;">My gripes</p>
            But I have a few things on my mind that I would like clarified:
            <br/>
            From a just war perspective, Ukraine's actions are moral and justified (except for the racism, of course). Putin had chances of success invading Ukraine; he bombed civilian residences; it was Ukraine's last resort, and the intention was to end the conflict. But I am a pacifist, and I cannot come to terms with ‘justifying war.' Why was there a need for immediate escalation and retaliation when Putin hinted at war for a month? The government officials of Ukraine just filed a lawsuit against Russia in the world court after asking for support from NATO, so maybe that speaks to the efficiency of our justice system at the time of urgency. I might be speaking from a place of ignorance, but I don't understand why the first instinct was to call the US to act as the protective big brother while bodies like the departments of the UN exist. Could there be a grayed line between the UN and G5?
            <br/><br/>
            My second gripe is on protests and the media. I fully support protests, and their positive effects are apparent, but I sometimes wonder if protests contribute to war where negotiation is possible. I feel like demonstrations are suitable for changing people's minds but not when other people's lives are at stake. I fail to believe that negotiation like the 2000s India-Pakistan conflict was impossible. As much as Putin refused negotiation, he had interviews with journalists from the West and the French president who would convince him of standing down. Protests and media fuel tension that forces a reaction from both parties. The media frames it as a competition where the winner will be crowned ‘world's superpower,' and protests lead to sanctions and military decisions that make the belligerent angrier. Putin's main claim was that the West's interference would lead to “consequences they have never seen in history. “  He said that the very thing we are doing would lead to an escalation. Before someone classifies it as Putin's excuse to justify his actions, his reason for anger (not actions) is valid too. So, could we have caused more conflict by protesting? Could the media have coerced NATO to take action on a non-NATO conflict? On the other hand, the lack of protesting and media coverage could have led to more loss of lives and subsequent subjugation of Ukraine. Even worse, people would have been dying without anyone knowing about it.
            <br/><br/>
            As much as I can support financially, virtually, emotionally, or spiritually, at the end of the day, I know I will never feel the same level of distraught as the people most affected. I wish we could all donate to remove Putin from power instead of buying supplies and equipment so that people can protect themselves. In a similar light, I have seen people on social media celebrating the success of deterring Russian forces physically using drones. But the next time we celebrate a win or criticize people who are neutral because we are emotionally charged, remember that the deceived 21-year-old Russian boy who went to the frontlines and got killed did not choose nor deserve death too. You might protest against Putin's actions, but it is the government whose actions are out of your control that hears your plea. Depending on how you look at it, you might have been the one who pulled the trolley's lever.
