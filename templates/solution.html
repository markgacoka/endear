        <p style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: 600;">A Proposed Solution to Social Isolation and Stratification</p>
        <p>In the sitcom show <i>How I Met your mother</i>, the yellow umbrella served as a significant object for magical encounters since it connected Ted and ‘the mother’ years before they met. If it was not for the yellow umbrella, Ted might not have met his future wife and ultimately have kids to tell the story to. To me, this literally and figuratively represents romanticism – an idealized view of love and social interactions which form unrealistic expectations in contemporary dating. While magical encounters might be possible (albeit with high survivorship bias), it is not effective for forming friendships. This is unless you make the numbers work for you.

            <p style="font-weight: 600;">The current problem of Minerva's model</p>
            Based on my observations which might be flawed, biased or outright wrong, I am of the opinion that the more we progress towards the graduation date, the less social Minerva students become. In addition to social isolation, people organize themselves into social groups which seldom interact with each other. Call it social stratification if you will. I see it as consequence of less group events like Minerva talks and 10:01's as well as closed-off apartment style housing, but there could be multiple factors. 
            <br/><br/>
            Based on the Group Development model, we had our forming phase in freshman year where we became oriented toward one another. During our late freshman and sophomore years, we passed through the storming phase where we found ourselves in conflict and solved it in order to improve the group environment. I believe we are in the norming phase where standards for behavior and roles develop that regulate behavior, but this is coming at the expense of loathing those who don’t share our likings. We should strive to quickly reach our performing phase where we work as a unit to achieve desired goals before we disband in the adjourning phase when we graduate.
            <br/><br/>
            From a network theory perspective, you might assume that Minerva students interacting socially would form a scale-free network which is characterized by the tendency of connections to follow a power law – but that is not the case. Instead, we follow a mesh topology with clusters as subgroups. 
            <br/><br/>
            As we are aware, clusters are inefficient for information and communication flow and tend to lead to groupthink. Furthermore, clusters are less robust (problems that can be solved easily by the majority are shielded by an in-group, an academic or behavioral misconduct affects the whole group and so on) and highly centralized (rumors and misinformation are disseminated and interpreted within the group but without the possibility of right of reply). I see the formation of non-interacting cliques as counter-intuitive to Minerva’s logos on international diversity. We pride ourselves in being not only diverse in our backgrounds, but also diverse in our thoughts, experiences and appearances. However, we still converge towards the most familiar face, the most familiar language, the most familiar behaviors. This is as paradoxical as the ultra rich forming foundations to pay themselves. We do not conform to ideas without critical thought but we conform to internal groups to solidify our perspective of others. We need to be proactively uncomfortable to learn about our neighbor, classmate or friend. Shoot your shot! That is how you make the numbers work for you. How can we be culturally versed externally without looking within? 
            <br/><br/>
            Another critique might be: but that’s how the world is. People just form groups of people similar to them. To which I respond, despite the world being a certain way, it does not imply that is the right way. I agree that the concern of similar interests (but not discrimination) would be appropriate when choosing a long-term partner. However, certain cultures and religions arrange marriages even before they interact with each other and these marriages are known to be as strong as an ox.

            <p style="font-weight: 600;">Why do you need a friend?</p>
            Aristotle distinguishes friendship into three kinds in the Nicomachean Ethics Book VIII: friendships of pleasure, utility and virtue. He postulates these three categories are the reasons why we love our friends. It is either because we derive pleasure from their interactions (friendships of pleasure), they are useful to us (utility) or they possess virtuous characters (virtue). Modern critiques ignore non-deficient forms of friendship such as pleasure and utility when determining why we show concern for our friends, but it stands true in today’s age of toxicity. However, I share the sentiments of philosophers such as Friedman who sees friends as equal relationships. If you tend to agree with Aristotle, then it is possible to find a friend who can help you down the road or make you a better person. But if you agree more with Friedman, it becomes a matter of seeing other students as your equals. However, superseding sympathy and empathy straight to compassion will allow you not to look at it from a teleological conception of action and making it a selfish personal quest, but a personal responsibility of making both you and your new friend better.
            <br/><br/>
            <p style="font-weight: 600;">The Solution<p>
            A simple solution would be designing a system that incentives social interactions with increased connections with peers that are not in our friend group as a metric of success. Through SI’s the process can be gamified to ensure that interest is upheld. To do this, a friendship equivalent of Endear where students are matched randomly to rekindle social interactions is an example solution. COVID restrictions? No problem. We commute virtually as a placeholder for in-person interactions alongside our dear beloved Zuck. After all, your whole degree is attained virtually.
            <br/><br/>
            You might ask – why then did you make Endear about matching with your secret crush and not a platform to incentivize interactions among friends? The answer boils down to three responses: finishing a job not well done, time constraints and curiosity.  There was an initial implementation of such a concept some years back with concerns about privacy and match-making inefficiency. However, there was still an expression of interest and my curiosity finally caught up with me. I have made Endear with no expectation of consumption but to answer one simple question. What if two Minervans who have a deep but secret admiration for each other could just know? Finally, Endear is a relatively simple implementation to match-making than automating friendly connections. It is based on the premise that two consenting adults can profess their interest and find mutual connection in one another with the benefit of privacy which technology provides with no intermediaries. The idea, inspiration and feedback for Endear was pitched to me as a problem by a couple of my friends, whom I am not sure want to be named. As a further testament to the need of such a solution, I prefaced by saying my observations might be flawed despite getting feedback from my friends due to the possible existence of groupthink. 
            <br/><br/>
            <p style="font-weight: 600;">Food for Thought<p>
            To close off, we should strive to make the social landscape at Minerva more like a random small-world network rather than a clustered one and that is my only request.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Update [02/24/2022]: </strong> It warms my heart to see Minervans coming together to support Ukraine against the oppression of Putin and reminds me of the countless number of times people have stood up for great causes. But how I wish negative events would not be the catalyst for unity and hope that the friendships would persist even after. Wishing Ukraine well!
