        <p style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: 600;">A Proposed Solution to Social Isolation and Stratification</p>
        <p>In the sitcom show, <i>How I Met your mother</i>, a yellow umbrella is a significant object for magical encounters. It connects Ted and 'the mother' years before they fall in love. If not for the yellow umbrella, Ted might not have met his future wife and ultimately have kids to tell the story. Personally, this literally and figuratively represents romanticism – an idealized view of love and social interactions which form unrealistic expectations in contemporary dating. While magical encounters might be possible (albeit with high survivorship bias), they are ineffective for forming friendships. Unless you make the numbers work for you.

            <p style="font-weight: 600;">The current problem with Minerva's model</p>
            Based on my observations that might be flawed, biased, or outright wrong, I believe that the more we progress towards graduation, the less social Minerva students become. In addition to social isolation, people organize themselves into social groups that seldom interact. Call it social stratification, if you will. I feel like it is due to fewer group events like Minerva talks and 10:01s and closed-off apartment-style housing, but there could be multiple factors.
            <br/><br/>
            In our first years, we had our forming phase, where we became oriented toward one another. We passed through the storming phase during our late first and second years, where we found ourselves in conflict and solved it to improve the group environment. I believe we are in the norming phase where standards for behavior and roles develop that regulate behavior, but this is coming at the expense of loathing those who don't share our likings. The objective is to reach the performing phase, i.e., working as a unit to achieve desired goals before the inevitable adjourning stage after graduation (see Group Development model).
            <br/><br/>
            From a network theory perspective, you might assume that the relationships at Minerva follow a scale-free network characterized by the tendency of connections to follow a power law – but that is not the case. Instead, we follow a mesh topology with clusters as subgroups.
            <br/><br/>
            As we know, clusters are inefficient for information and communication flow and tend to lead to groupthink. They are less robust and highly centralized. You tend to see problems that can be solved easily by the majority shielded by a group. Additionally, rumors are disseminated and interpreted within a group without the possibility of the right to reply. I see the formation of non-interacting cliques as counter-intuitive to Minerva's logos on international diversity. We pride ourselves in being not only diverse in our backgrounds but also diverse in our thoughts, experiences, and appearances. However, we still converge towards the most familiar face (homophily), the most familiar language, and the most familiar behaviors. Can this be more paradoxical than the ultra-rich forming foundations to pay themselves? We do not conform to ideas without critical thought. However, we conform to internal groups to solidify our perspective of others. We need to be proactively uncomfortable learning about our neighbor, classmate, or friend. Shoot your shot! That is how you make the numbers work for you. How can we be culturally versed externally without looking within?
            <br/><br/>
            Another critique might be, 'That's how the world is.' People form groups of people similar to them. Despite the world being a certain way, it does not imply the right way. I agree that the concern of similar interests (but not discrimination) would be appropriate when choosing a long-term partner. However, specific cultures and religions arrange marriages even before they interact. These marriages are known to be as strong as an ox.
            <br/><br/>
            <p style="font-weight: 600;">Why do you need a friend?</p>
            In the Nicomachean Ethics Book VIII, Aristotle distinguishes friendship into three kinds: friendships of pleasure, utility, and virtue. He postulates that these three categories are why we love our friends. It is either because we derive joy from their interactions (friendships of pleasure), they are helpful to us (utility), or they possess virtuous characters (virtue). Modern critiques ignore non-deficient forms of friendship such as pleasure and utility when determining why we show concern for our friends. However, it stands true in today's age of toxicity. I share similar sentiments with philosophers such as Friedman, who sees friends as equal relationships. If you agree with Aristotle, it is possible to find a friend who can help you down the road or make you a better person. But if you agree more with Friedman, it becomes a matter of seeing other students as your equals. Superseding sympathy and empathy straight by being compassionate allows you to look at it from a teleological conception of action (personal quests) and personal responsibility of improving yourself and your potentially new friend.
            <br/><br/>
            <p style="font-weight: 600;">The Solution<p>
            A simple solution would be designing a system that incentives social interactions with peers that are not in our friend group. The process can be gamified through student initiatives to uphold interest. To do this, a friendship equivalent of Endear, where students match randomly to rekindle social interactions, is an example solution. COVID restrictions? No problem. We commute virtually as a placeholder for in-person interactions alongside our dear beloved Zuck. After all, the Minerva experience is online.
            <br/><br/>
            Why then did you make Endear about matching with your secret crush and not a platform to incentivize interactions among friends? The answer boils down to three responses: finishing a job not well done, time constraints, and curiosity. Some years back, there was an initial implementation of such a concept with concerns about privacy and match-making inefficiency. However, there was still an expression of interest, and my curiosity finally caught up with me. I have made Endear with no expectation of consumption but to answer a straightforward question. What if two Minervans who have a deep but secret admiration for each other could know? Finally, Endear is a relatively simple implementation of match-making. Endear is based on the premise that two consenting adults can profess their interests and find a mutual connection in one another. This does not come at the expense of privacy. With today's technology, an intermediary is neither sought out nor required, and the fear of rejection will be present.
            <br/><br/>
            <p style="font-weight: 600;">Food for Thought<p>
            To close off, I strongly feel that we should strive to make the social landscape at Minerva more like a random small-world network rather than a clustered one.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Update [02/24/2022]: </strong> It warms my heart to see Minervans coming together to support Ukraine against the oppression of Putin. This reminds me of the countless times people have stood up for great causes. But how I wish adverse events would not be the catalyst for unity and hope that the friendships would persist even after. I wish Ukraine well!
